## Project brief

Decentralised online examination application on Ethereum

Nowadays, the need of online examination is sharply growing due to the popularity of distance learning at educational institution. However, the existing online examination platform with centralized authentication scheme and centralized data storage is facing many security challenges. Examinee impersonation, exam paper leakage and database crash are all very common issues that has received considerable critical attention. Before an examination, how to better verify identification of the examinee who is taking an exam? How to strengthen confidentiality, integrity, and availability of exam paper? After an examination, how to protect answer sheet from being tampered with? 

Blockchain technology can play an important role in addressing the problems of examinee authentication, exam data security and availability. This research provides an exciting opportunity to advance reliability of online examination based on smart contracts and Ethereum. The contributions of this dissertation can be summarized as follows: Implementation of a decentralized online examination application which provides examinee authentication and secured exam paper delivery.
